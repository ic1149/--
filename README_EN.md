## Love of python

(modified from Love of Lotus, a classical Chinese poem)

Water and ground, grass and wood, there are many things to love. Torvalds from Finland loves C only. Since Sun Microsystems, everyone has loved Java so much. I only love python's cleaniness among silt, not arrogant; passes straight through, not branching, aroma transmitting far, standing still, able to spectate from far away but not brute forced. 

I believe: C is the hard worker behind apps, java is versatile; python is the gentleman. Yeah! C's love, rare after Torvalds. Python's love, who understands? Java's love is the majority.
